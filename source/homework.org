Design an instruction booklet on how to solder components together correctly. Make sure your booklet/poster should include:

	-	Step-by-step instruction on how to solder.
	-	What does a good solder joint look like.
	-	Mistakes that can be made.
	- 	How to ensure your safety.

-  Firstly, explain, step-by-step, how you would test the value of a resistor using a multimeter.

- Secondly, The multimeters we use have scale for measuring resistance, it is:

		- 2000k
		- 200k
		- 20k
		- 2000
		- 200

  For the following resistors, which scale would you select in order to get the best reading possible:

		- 1000 ohms (1k)
		- 220 ohms
		- 10 000 ohms (10k)
		- 220 000 ohms (220k)
